<h1> 4 Essential Filter Coffee Variables </h1>
Filter coffee is universal in the coffee industry. Whether you’re an aspiring home brewer or a 
seasoned veteran, it’s likely that your first experience was some sort of filter coffee. 
Below I’ll briefly take you through what I believe are the most important filter coffee brewing variables 
(in order of importance). 
<h3> The roasted coffee itself! </h3>
This seems obvious but other introductory articles on filter coffee barely talk about how to
brew different types of coffee. The origin of the coffee and it’s roasting process contribute more than ⅔ 
of the end product (and how tasty it is!). Origin and bean varieties influence the density and porosity of 
your bean- this affects how your bean grinds. Generally speaking the denser and harder your bean is, the 
coarser it’ll grind and the more fines it’ll produce.

Although good quality green coffee has the potential to be delicious, how your coffee is roasted is 
crucial. A highly graded Panama Geisha roasted inappropriately can, and will taste like wet cardboard, 
vice versa.
